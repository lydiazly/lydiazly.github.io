We formed a team named Stardial and published our first website: [Star Path Viewer](https://star-path-viewer.pages.dev). This is an open-source web application designed for academic research. This astronomical tool allows users to trace the path of any planet or star across the sky based on a chosen date in either the Gregorian or Julian calendar, spanning millennia into both the past and the future.

Compared to other existing tools, Star Path Viewer provides more precise information on star positions and rising/setting times, which is crucial for historians when dating historical events by correlating astrometric data with historical records. The tool also enables future prediction of star paths, aiding users in planning astronomical observations.

The star search is compatible with Chinese star names. It is a valuable function for historians of science studying ancient Chinese archives and astronomy.
