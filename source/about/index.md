Welcome! This is Lydia Zhang. This blog is about my notes of Python, basically related to solar physics, but not restricted.

Some of the articles and Jupyter notebooks are backups of my two Python lectures in 2018 when I was in the Solar Physics Group, Nanjing University. The lectures are given to students, also researchers who are new to Python or SunPy. The contents are based on my own research experience. Hope they help.

Custom scripts and modules are just examples. Due to the development of SciPy, Astropy, and SunPy, some user-defined functions may no longer be necessary.

Please contact me if you have any questions. :)
