Welcome! This is Lydia Zhang. I transitioned to computer science in 2023. This is my personal blog, where I keep my Python notes and other coding tips.

Some of the posts and Jupyter notebooks (in Chinese) [[1](/main), [2](/advance)] are archives of two Python lectures I gave in 2018 while I was a member of the Solar Physics Group at Nanjing University. The lectures were designed to introduce Python and scientific packages to students and researchers. Most of the contents were based on my previous research experience. The custom scripts and modules included are just examples.

Although some of these early posts might be outdated after all these years, and a few user-defined functions may no longer be necessary, I've decided to leave them as they are since the key concepts are still applicable. New tips and notes will be shared in future posts.

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions. :)
